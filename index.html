<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
- If a non-enblish language web browser is detected, you should automatically be offered a translated page</br>
or</br>
- Find the Google Translate Widget in the top left of the page. Select your preferred language.
</p>
<h2>
So, what does this mean to the User?
</h2>
<p>
- All the content is frozen as of the moment the pages sere replicated. This means that if there are any changes to the original pages, those are not automatically reflected on these pages. But, if you do notice a change, popping a message to tsu2 on the Novell/Attachmate messaging system is appreciated (login to any openSUSE page, then send a private message)
</p>
<p>
- Only the pages  linked directly from this page are translated Internal page links will work, but if a link to a location off the page is clicked, the User will most likely be taken to a page not on this site(usually back to opensuse.org).
</p>
<p>
Note that these pages are implemented with MACHINE TRANSLATION. No guarantee is made that any human being has evaluated the accuracy or clearness of translated text. In particular, although MACHINE TRANSLATION translates everything including what supposedly is seen on the machine, the machine will actually display according to whatever its language setting which may not be the same as your native language..
</p>
So,</br>
<b><font color=red>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</font></b>

<h2>
Purpose of this DEMO
</h2>
<p>
Awhile back I had some discussions where experts opined that highly technical documents could not be translated, and any resulting machine translations were therefor worthless. Maybe, and these DEMO pages should show the current state of what might be possible with this technology. In any case, these pages might be the only resource for any that are not the officially supported languages.
</p>
<p>
I'm also curious whether something like this has value in at least providing a starting point before humans might fine tune for official versions.
</p>

<h2>
To Users - Recommended practice
</h2>
<p>
- If an officially supported language version is available and accuracy is critical, don't use these pages. Even on these translated pages, usually a group of links can be found in the left Navigational pane which will take you directly to an officially supported version of the page.
</p>
<p>
- If you are a native speaker and you find some phrases aren't accurate, please use the Google options to suggest changes. Not only might the page itself be modified by Google, but other similar pages may be improved as well.
</p>
<p>
- If there is a page you'd like to have translated without submitting the page to an online Translator, suggest the page to me for consideration. On your suggestion I may deploy an automatically translated page for that as well.
</p>
<p>
- If you are a fluent native speaker who is willing to endorse the usability of any of these pages, pop me a message and spread the word! These pages are meant only to enhance available usable Public resources.
</p>
<p>
- Feedback! - Comments are needed whether these pages are helpful or not. Insturctions how to Contribute and Contact are near the beginning of this document.

<h2>
Mini-FAQ
</h2>
<p>
<b>What is Machine Translation and what are its drawbacks?</b></br>
Machine Translation is what you might guess... The translation is performed by machine algorithm only. Unfortunately, human languages vary greatly in their linguistic syntax and structure so it can be difficult to create <fluent> translations that conform with a native language's practice. This is why most machine translations today are largely word matching, but attempts have also been made to employ natural language processing to apply additional phrasing rules. Today only some of the major languages are currently being worked on and must be largely completed before considering the complexities of translation. This is why machine translations will often sound funny but are hopefully understandable.
</p>
<p>
<b>Why this replicated website instead of a true clone or mirror?</b></br>
After some experimentation, I did not find a reliable way to overcome XSS (cross site sripting) issues. XSS has rightly been blocked in all recent web browsers due to the abuse and possibility of creating spear phishing attacks that don't just look like original websites but actually perform MITM attacks. The decision was also made not to deploy a full WikiMedia website, only static pages.
</p>
<p>
<b>How was a working copy of the original page made?</b></br>
The original pages are deployed on WikiMedia which means that each page contains numerous references to external CSS and scripts. Simply copying the HTML is not adequate. The most current version of wget was used with options to collect all required external assets and re-write links for local only deployment. Curiously, I found that trying to replicate numerous pages at once fails, but retrieving one page at a time seems to work.
</p>
<p>
<b>Why, how did you decide on the machine translation technology?</b></br>
Because all major web search engines need to support global languages for both querying and providing results, the biggest engines like Google and Bing have made their translation services publicly available at no cost. This is done so that Community can improve results by submitting modifications. And, hopefully this will not change any time in the near future. The alternatives suffer from a variety of problems, including more labor intensive contributions, a design that makes Community contributions less likely, limited resources compared to the major search engines.
