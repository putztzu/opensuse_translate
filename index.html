TSU Unofficial openSUSE Documentation Alternative Translation Project

This is an unofficial Community project, unauthorized and without any connection to openSUSE, SUSE or any other Attachmate property. 

In an effort to extend the reach of openSUSE, this project is only a DEMO of machine translation.

Only the content has been replicated from the original openSUSE pages, not the underlying code so this cannot be considered a "mirror" or "clone of the original openSUSE pages.

So, what does this mean to the User?

- All the content is frozen as of the moment the pages sere replicated. This means that if there are any changes to the original pages, those are not automatically reflected on these pages. But, if you do notice a change, popping a message to tsu2 on the Novell/Attachmate messaging system is appreciated (login to any openSUSE page, then send a private message)

- Only the pages you see are replicated. Linkx to locations on the same page will work. Links to locations not on the same page will fail.

Note that these pages are implemented with MACHINE TRANSLATION. No guarantee is made that any human being has evaluated the accuracy or clearness of translated text.

So,
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

**************************************
Purpose of this DEMO

Awhile back I had some discussions where experts opined that highly technical documents could not be translated, and any resulting machine translations were therefor worthless. Maybe, and these DEMO pages should show the current state of what might be possible with this technology. In any case, these pages might be the only resource for any that are not the officially supported languages.

I'm also curious whether something like this has value in at least providing a starting point before humans might fine tune for official versions.

**************************************
To Users - Recommended practice

- If an officially supported language version is available and accuracy is critical, don't use these pages.

- If you are a native speaker and you find some phrases aren't accurate, please use the Google options to suggest changes. Not only might the page itself be modified eventually, but other similar pages may be improved in the future.

- If there is a page you'd like to have translated without submittin the page to a Translator, suggest the page to me for consideration. On your suggestion I may deploy an automatically translated page for that as well.

- If you are a fluent native speaker who is willing to endorse the usability of any of these pages, pop me a message and spread the word! These pages are meant only to enhance available usable Public resources.

- Feedback! - Assuming you're an openSUSE user, go to the regular openSUSE website, login and send me a message what you think works or doesn't work!

Mini-FAQ 
What is Machine Translation and what are its drawbacks?
Machine Translation is what you might guess... The translation is performed by a machine algorithm only. Unfortunately, human languages vary greatly in their linguistic syntax and structure so it can be difficult to create <fluent> translations that conform with a native language's practice. This is why most machine translations today are largely word matching, but attempts have also been made to employ natural language processing to apply additional phrasing rules, but today only some of the major languages are currently being worked on and must be largely completed before considering the complexities of translation. This is why machine translations will often sound funny but are hopefully understandable.

Why this replicated website instead of a true clone or mirror?
After some experimentation, I did not find a reliable way to overcome XSS (cross site sripting) issues. This has rightly been blocked in all recent web browsers due to the abuse and possibility of creating spear phishing attacks that don't just look like original websites but actually perform MITM attacks. The decision was also made not to deploy a full WikiMedia website, only static pages.

How did you create a working copy of the original page?
The original pages are deployed on WikiMedia which means that each page contains numerous references to external CSS and scripts. Simply copying the HTML is not adequate. The most current version of wget was used with options to collect all required external assets and re-write links for local only deployment. Curiously, I found that trying to replicate numerous pages at once fails, but retrieving one page at a time seems to work.

Why, how did you decide on the machine translation technology?
Because all major web search engines need to support global languages for both querying and providing results, the biggest engines like Google and Bing have made their translation services publicly available at no cost. This is done so that Community can improve results by submitting modifications. And, hopefully this will not change any time in the near future. The alternatives suffer from a variety of problems, including more labor intensive contributions, a design that makes Community contributions less likely, limited resources compared to the major search engines.
